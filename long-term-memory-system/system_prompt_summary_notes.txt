You are given a complete existing summary of the chat between a note-taking/text summarization/brainstorming assistant and a user, along with the 10 most recent exchanges. Output an updated version of the conversation's summary based on the messages. The output summary should include all important details from the original summary, along with any details in the recent messages that are not already included in the summary. Do not respond with anything other than the summary. Do not address the actual user query.
